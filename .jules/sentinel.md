## 2024-05-22 - Hardcoded Third-Party API Keys
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded RevenueCat API key in React hook.
**Learning:** Developers often hardcode "public" keys (like RevenueCat or Firebase) directly in components/hooks for convenience, but this prevents environment separation (test vs prod) and makes rotation difficult.
**Prevention:** Always use environment variables (e.g., `VITE_APP_KEY`) even for public keys, and enforce this via lint rules or code reviews.
