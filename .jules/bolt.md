# Bolt's Journal

## 2024-05-22 - [Initial Journal Creation]
**Learning:** Journal created.
**Action:** Record critical learnings here.

## 2026-02-26 - [Route-based Code Splitting]
**Learning:** Monolithic bundle size was driven by static imports of 15 large views in `App.tsx`. Implementing `React.lazy` with `Suspense` automatically triggered Vite to generate separate chunks for each route, reducing initial load weight significantly.
**Action:** When adding new views, always use `React.lazy` imports and verify chunk generation with `pnpm build`. Ensure fallbacks are scoped appropriately (e.g., content area vs full screen).

## 2026-03-01 - [React Context Object Re-render Trap & Memoization]
**Learning:** Using an unmemoized object literal as a Context `value` forces *every* consuming component to re-render on every Provider render, bypassing React's bailout mechanisms. This creates massive performance bottlenecks in large component trees (like WorkspaceContext and SettingsContext) because a new object reference is created even if the underlying data hasn't changed.
**Action:** Always wrap Context Provider `value` objects in `useMemo` with a complete and correctly configured dependency array to ensure referential equality and prevent unnecessary downstream re-renders.

## 2025-03-09 - [Path Pruning for Recursive React Context Updates]
**Learning:** In highly nested data structures like `FileNode[]` stored in React state, recursive operations such as mapping (`updateFileContent`, `renameFile`), filtering (`deleteFile`), or adding (`createFile`) can inadvertently trigger full O(N) tree traversals across thousands of nodes. This causes significant UI blocking in features like file explorers when typing or making frequent changes.
**Action:** Always implement path prefix pruning in recursive state updates (e.g., `if (targetPath.startsWith(node.path + '/'))`). This bypasses unnecessary branches, successfully optimizing the state update logic from O(N) to O(log N).

## 2025-05-22 - [Optimize React State Updates with Early Returns for Sets]
**Learning:** State updates for Set structures (like `unsavedFiles` in WorkspaceContext) should implement early returns (e.g., `prev.has(x) ? prev : new Set(prev).add(x)`). Without this, frequent state updates create new Set instances and trigger unnecessary downstream React component invalidations, bypassing referential equality checks and causing performance bottlenecks.
**Action:** When updating Set or Map data structures in React state, especially in frequently updated contexts, always check if the new state is identical to the previous state and return the previous instance if so to preserve referential equality.
