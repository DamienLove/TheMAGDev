# Bolt's Journal

## 2024-05-22 - [Initial Journal Creation]
**Learning:** Journal created.
**Action:** Record critical learnings here.

## 2026-02-26 - [Route-based Code Splitting]
**Learning:** Monolithic bundle size was driven by static imports of 15 large views in `App.tsx`. Implementing `React.lazy` with `Suspense` automatically triggered Vite to generate separate chunks for each route, reducing initial load weight significantly.
**Action:** When adding new views, always use `React.lazy` imports and verify chunk generation with `pnpm build`. Ensure fallbacks are scoped appropriately (e.g., content area vs full screen).

## 2024-03-01 - React Context Object Re-render Trap
**Learning:** Using an unmemoized object literal as a Context `value` forces *every* consuming component to re-render on every Provider render, bypassing React's bailout mechanisms. This creates massive performance bottlenecks in large component trees (like WorkspaceContext and SettingsContext).
**Action:** Always wrap Context Provider `value` objects in `useMemo` with a complete dependency array to ensure referential equality when underlying values haven't changed.
